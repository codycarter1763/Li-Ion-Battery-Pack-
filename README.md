# Overview

<h5>A freind of mine came to me with an idea of building an electric go kart. So we started planning a design to see what we needed to make this idea a reality.
  My friend had bought a beefy brushless motor system for a previous project so we decided to work with that. As we started gathering the materials, we found that it was more economical to 
  create our own battery pack. That way we could tailor the pack to our specific needs and save lots of funds.</h5>
