# Overview

<h5>A freind of mine came to me with an idea of building an electric go kart. So we started planning a design to see what we needed to make this idea a reality.
  My friend had bought a beefy brushless motor system for a previous project so we decided to work with that. As we started gathering the materials, we found that it was more economical to 
  create our own battery pack. That way we could tailor the pack to our specific needs and save lots of funds.</h5>

# Design
<h5>We decided to go with a 72 volt battery with 20AH capacity and 160 safe amp delivery for the brushless system. I found a stl file on thingiverse for a single battery spacer and I used AutoCAD to put them in a 8x5 grid for easier construction and our names etched in the side.</h5>
